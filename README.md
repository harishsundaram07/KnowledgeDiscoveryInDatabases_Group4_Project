Introduction to Problem:
To draw insights from a Tennis dataset wrt players age and correlation with the win and loss trend and also analyzing the change in participation and performance of the tennis players from major countries like USA, UK, etc. 
In the earlier days of Tennis, the players would retire by the age of 30, but in recent times, the players have been playing at the age of around 35 and performing well. We will be analyzing the change in the pattern of participation
Among the tennis players.

Research Questions: 

What is the win percentage of players having the age in the range of 20-30 vs 30 and above for male and female players. 
What is the different winning percentage of a player from a specific country on different surfaces?
The percentage of wins between players from the US vs other popular countries and between age groups ranging from 20-30 and then greater than 30.
What factor is influencing the change in the trend of all male and female players winning the championship? If it's the surface, the age, or some other reason.



Few of the graph analysis below:

The above graph gives a view of age vs year of male players, which shows us which age group performed well given an year. The colors represent the following

1. Blue : Ages 20 to 25

2. Red: Ages 25 to 30

3. Green: Ages 30 to 35

4. Orange: Ages 35 and above

As we can see, players between the ages of 25 and 30 had consistent wins in games as compared to other age groups.

Age group 20 to 25 had some years with higher win percentage but weren't consistent for long.

Age groups 30 to 35 and 35 and above had the worst win percentages.

The above graph gives a view of age vs year of female players, which shows us which age group performed well given an year. The colors represent the following

1. Blue : Ages 20 to 25

2. Red: Ages 25 to 30

3. Green: Ages 30 to 35

4. Orange: Ages 35 and above

We can conclude that female players are more likely to win when they are in the age group of 20 to 25, not consistent, but this age group has the maximum wins overall.

Female players are leaste likely to play and win with age above 35.




FURTHER ANALYSIS WILL BE DONE USING VARIOUS DECRIPTIVE ANALYSIS METHODS PROVIDED DURING THE MODEL PLANNING. WE TEND TO INCLUDE MANY MORE GRAPHS AND CHARTS TO UNDERSTAND WHY CERTAIN FACTOR IS INFLUENCING THE CHANGE IN THE TREND OF ALL MALE AND FEMALE PLAYERS WINNING THE CHAMPIONSHIP.
